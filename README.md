We use aleo_iou_v2_2.aleo to build an Aleo application named AleoIOU. You can use AleoIOU to borrow and lend Aleo tokens on the Aleo public chain.

## Loan Process

### Apply
After the borrower and lender agree on the loan terms offline, the borrower initiates the loan by calling the `apply` function. The borrower needs to input the loan information, including:
- Personal information such as wallet addresses, names, and addresses of both parties.
- Loan details such as the loan amount, date, repayment deadline, and annual interest rate.

Upon successful invocation, the contract will output loan application records for both the borrower and the lender.

### Disburse
If the lender agrees to the loan, they can call the `disburse` function to make the loan disbursement to the borrower. The lender needs to provide the following information:
- Loan application record.
- Loan amount (Aleo credits) provided by the lender.

Upon successful invocation, the contract will output loan disbursement records for both the borrower and the lender and transfer the loan amount to the borrower. The disbursement records can be used as proof that the lender has made the payment and that the borrower has received the loan.

### Repay
On the agreed repayment date, the borrower calls the `repay` function to repay the loan to the lender. The borrower needs to provide the following information:
- Loan application record.
- Loan disbursement record.
- Aleo credits provided by the lender.
- Start block height.
- End block height.

Upon successful invocation, the contract will output loan repayment records for both the borrower and the lender and transfer the repayment amount to the lender. Similarly, the repayment records can be used as proof that the borrower has completed the repayment and that the lender has received the repayment.

## Some problems
Due to the current limited capabilities of the Leo language, some functions of aleo_iou_v2_2.aleo have not yet been completed, and there will be problems in actual operation, including:
- No string type
- Both leo build and aleo build fail when credits.aleo is imported

We hope that subsequent updates of the Leo language can help us solve the above problems, or provide other solutions.

## Running the Program

Leo provides users with a command line interface for compiling and running Leo programs.
Users may either specify input values via the command line or provide an input file in `inputs/`.

### Configuring Accounts
The `program.json` file contains a private key and address. 
This is the account that will be used to sign transactions and is checked for record ownership.
When executing programs as different parties, be sure to set the `private_key` and `address` fields in `program.json` to the appropriate values.</br>
See `./run.sh` for an example of how to run the program as different parties.
